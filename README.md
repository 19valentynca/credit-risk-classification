# credit-risk-classification  
-In this Challenge, we use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. We use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.  
-Using sub-sections we:
1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

As a result of our findings, we were able to see the accuracy of our machine learning techniques in our loan risk dataset.
